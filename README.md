### ðŸ¤” Myself?
- I have a Master's degree in Computational Linguistics from IMS, UniversitÃ¤t Stuttgart, with the primary focus being on Applied Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Multi-Modality in NLP.
- I used to write a lot of Java and C++ (honourable mention, JS) in the past but ever since I started my master's degree, I got hardstuck into Python
and that's where I am now.
- Pytorch and Jax.
- Other than Python, I am an open-source and Linux aficionado, (no I don't use Arch, btw). I am also a tinkerer at home and may have self-hosted a lot of things (I need to check what's currently running on my home server).
- Also, Docker and Podman. 

- I've prior experience as a Software Engineer (I only wrote Javascript, to be precise).
- I have organised workshops and tutorials for students, ranging from beginner to intermediate topics in Machine Learning, Linux and Software Development.
- I've also been a teaching assistant for the Bachelor's and Master's programming courses offered at IMS from 2020 to 2023.
- Junior AI Engineer at ellamind GmbH from April 2024
