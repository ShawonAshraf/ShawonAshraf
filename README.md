### ðŸ¤” Myself?
I have a Master's degree in Computational Linguistics from UniversitÃ¤t Stuttgart, specializing in Applied NLP, Machine Learning, and Multi-Modality in NLP. I primarily work on LLM based applications (RAG, Fine-Tuning, Evaluation, Synthetic Data Generation) and I also contribute to open-source initiatives. My professional experience includes being a Software Engineer (JavaScript and Swift), organizing workshops, serving as a teaching assistant. 

### OpenToWork
Currently looking for oppotunities in  AI engineer roles!
