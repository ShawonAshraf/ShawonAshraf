### ðŸ¤” Myself?
I have a Master's degree in Computational Linguistics from UniversitÃ¤t Stuttgart, specializing in Applied NLP, Machine Learning, and Multi-Modality in NLP, with a firm grip on Python, PyTorch, and Jax. Previously skilled in Java and C++, I now primarily focus on Python for LLM based applications (RAG, Fine-Tuning, Evaluation, Synthetic Data Generation) and contribute to open-source initiatives, emphasizing container (Docker, Podman) based workflows. My professional experience includes being a Software Engineer (JavaScript and Swift), organizing workshops, serving as a teaching assistant, and currently working as a Junior AI Engineer at ellamind GmbH while contributing to DiscoResearch.
