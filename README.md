### ðŸ¤” Myself?
In brief: I have a Master's degree in Computational Linguistics from IMS, UniversitÃ¤t Stuttgart, with the primary focus being on Applied Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Multi-Modality in NLP. I used to write a lot of Java and C++ (honourable mention, JS) in the past but ever since I started my master's degree, I got hardstuck into Python
and that's where I am now. I can work with PyTorch and Jax for scientific computation. Data visualization is something I really need to improve on but it's not terrible either. I am currently planning a tutorial series on NLP and Deep Learning in Bangla, aimed at beginners. Other than that, I am also compiling a repository 
of practical examples using libraries from the Jax ecosystem (mainly Jax, Flax and Optax), which is motivated by the problems I had encountered when I started learning Jax. I also have a blog site but I'm not sure when was the last time I wrote something in there. 

Other than Python, I am an open-source and Linux aficionado, (no I don't use Arch, btw). I am also a tinkerer at home and may have self-hosted a lot of things (I need to check what's currently running on my home server). Also, Docker and Podman. 

I've prior experience as a Software Engineer (I only wrote Javascript, to be precise). Alongside, I have organised workshops and tutorials for students, ranging from beginner to intermediate topics in Machine Learning, Linux and Software Development. I've also been a teaching assistant for the Bachelor and Master's programming courses offered at IMS from 2020 to 2023.
